# 2018Fall_DL_project
SNU graduate DL project. Using UTK_Face data, it aims to make person's image young.

## Date 
2018_fall Deep Learning Course Final project(2018-12-17)

## Member
YeongJunHan, Yuntae Kang

## Methods
Based on web_crawling and face detection,
- Cycle-GAN (https://github.com/xhujoy/CycleGAN-tensorflow)
- CAAE (https://github.com/ZZUTK/Face-Aging-CAAE)

## Data
